# WELCOME to the VILLAGE MARKET PLACE : Buyam Sellam (B&S)

In my home land where i came from, "Buyam sellam" stands for peoples holding very small businesses as resellers. 
They buy goods from peoples holding big businesses and resell to others by making very little marging benefit.
We, the B&S Company Ltd classify ourself in that category of business with the view in the long run to make it big.

In Africa many farmers are not able to sale their harvests to a wider market because of limited transportation means. With the penetration rate of INTERNET coupled with communication technologies as 4G people in far regions/villages are reachable. So our core activity is to get in touch with those farmers to buy their harvests and resell on this village market platform or to partnership with them and expose their products on this platform for more visibility.


## Features 
This platforms targets two main audiences category. People coming to buy the goods we expose and those getting in touch in order for us to buy their products or to partnership and use our platform for marketing purposes such as advertising their own products.
From our pespective both audiences are our customers :
    - A customer could register as a buyer who comes and order goods. He would register himself with credentials in the first place. Then later on when he regulary wants to order goods he will log in. A regular customer will receive rewards in a long run, such as discounts or free dilevery of his/her orders, ... etc
    - A customer could register himself as a partner or associate.
     An assoaciate is a small customer who has some goods and would like to sell them to us or would like us to expose on the platform. The platform will let him upload his contents that will be validated by us before exposure to the public.
    A partner is a customer with many goods, owning perhaps his own wharehouse and uses our platform for maketing purposes. He/she will register accordingly.
  
    The platform will enable associate and partners to follow up somes statistics on the platform such as their stock of orders.

## Testing 

All pages were thouroughly tested thoughout the coding process. Each time a small module was added in the code, it was tested on browsers such as Chrome, Opera and IE in order to ensure compatibility.
The media query fonction is used in the code in order to ensure adaptation with the viewport (screen size). The browser was streched from time to time to see te effect of resizing. The website on Gitpod was made public in order to test the pages on mobile phones as well.

After testing all the HTML pages locally, the HTML and CSS codes were also tested on validators such as W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw validator.
